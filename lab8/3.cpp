/*
In many graphical and physics applications, 2D vectors are used to represent directions, velocities, and forces. In this task, a class Vector2D that encapsulates a vectorâ€™s x and y components is to be developed using appropriate operator overloading methods. The class should support scalar operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication (scaling). In addition, you will provide a friend function to calculate the dot product between two vectors. Another function will be implemented to find the magnitude (length) of a vector. The goal is to create a flexible class with overloading and a friend function to access the private data directly.

Requirements:

Create a class Vector2D with private data members for the x and y coordinates.

Overload the +, -, and * operators to allow vector addition and scaling.

Overload the stream insertion operator (<<) to support outputting a vector.

Define a friend function dotProduct() to compute the dot product between two vectors.

Define another function magnitude() to get the vector length.

Write a main function to create sample vectors, perform operations, and print the results.
